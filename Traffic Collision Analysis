#Data Source: The data used for this analysis was sourced from The California Traffic Collision Data from SWITRS. This database contains information about traffic collisions reported by the CHP.

#Analysis:


#County and District Analysis:

/* 1. To find which reporting counties have the highest number of collisions I used the COUNT function to get the total number of collisions and with the GROUP BY and ORDER BY clause I organize them by total collisions in descending order.*/
SELECT county_location, COUNT(*) AS "number of collisions"
FROM collisions
GROUP BY county_location
ORDER BY "number of collisions" DESC;

/* 2. Finding how many collisions occurred in each reporting district I used the COUNT function and for the average collision severity for each district I used the AVG function. Using the INNER JOIN, GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses I'm able to filter the results by each reporting district.*/
SELECT col.reporting_district,COUNT(*) AS "collision count" ,AVG(col.collision_severity) AS "avg collisions severity"
FROM collisions col
INNER JOIN case_ids id
ON col.case_id = id.case_id
GROUP BY col.reporting_district
ORDER BY col.reporting_district;

/* 3. Analyzing how many collisions resulted in fatalities or severe injuries for each reporting district I used the SUM aggregates to find the total fatalities and severe injury count. With the WHERE and GROUP BY clause I filter them by reporting district and with the ORDER BY clause I organize them by fatalities and severe injuries in descending order by districts.*/
SELECT reporting_district, SUM(killed_victims) AS "total fatalities",SUM(severe_injury_count) AS "total severe injuries"
FROM collisions
WHERE reporting_district IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY reporting_district
ORDER BY "total fatalities" AND "total severe injuries" DESC;


#Weather and Time Analysis:

/* 1. To analyze the relationship between weather conditions and number of collisions I utilized the COUNT function to gather the total number of collisions. Using the WHERE, GROUP BY and ORDER BY I filter the results by weather and the number of collisions.*/
SELECT weather_1, weather_2 , COUNT(*) AS "number of collisions"
FROM collisions
WHERE weather_1 IS NOT NULL AND weather_2 IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY weather_1, weather_2
ORDER BY "number of collisions"; 

/* 2. To find how many collisions occurred in clear weather vs. adverse weather conditions I used the CASE statement to help filter the weather conditions. Using the COUNT function I get the total collisions and with the WHERE, GROUP and ORDER BY clause it organizes the data by weather condition and total collisions in descending order.*/
SELECT 
    CASE 
    WHEN weather_1 = "Clear" THEN "Clear" 
    ELSE "Adverse"
    END AS weather_condition,
    COUNT(*) AS "total collisions"
    FROM collisions
    WHERE weather_1 IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY weather_condition
    ORDER BY "total collisions" DESC;

/* 3. Analyzing how the time of day affects the frequency of collisions I used the CASE statement to get the collision time and filter it by AM and PM. With the GROUP and ORDER BY clause I'm able to organize it by hour of the day.*/ 
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN CAST(strftime("%H", collision_time) AS INTEGER) < 12
        THEN strftime("%I", collision_time) = "AM"
        ELSE strftime("%I", collision_time) = "PM"
        END AS "hour of day", 
        COUNT(*) AS "collision count"
FROM collisions
GROUP BY "hour of day"
ORDER BY "hour of day";

/* 4. The monthly trend in the number of collisions over the last five years can be found using the strftime function to get the month and year. With the WHERE clause I can calculate the collision date over the past 5 years. Using both the GROUP and ORDER BY I can filter it by collision date.*/ 
SELECT strftime('%m', collision_date) AS month, strftime('%Y', collision_date) AS year, COUNT(*) AS total_collisions
FROM collisions
WHERE collision_date >= date('2021-06-03' , '-5 years')
GROUP BY strftime('%m', collision_date), strftime('%Y', collision_date)
ORDER BY month;


#Collision Severity and Factors:

/* 1. To find how often collisions result in fatalities and severe injuried victims I used the SUM aggregate to find the total fatalities and total injured and I organize them with the GROUP BY clause by the collision severity.*/
SELECT collision_severity, SUM(killed_victims) AS "total_fatalities", SUM(injured_victims) AS "total injured"
FROM collisions 
GROUP BY collision_severity;

/*2. To get the distribution of victim injuries to vary by the primary collision factor I used the COUNT function to get the total collisions and with the INNER JOIN im able to join the Victims table and group them by injuries based on thier collisions and organize them with the ORDER BY of total collisions in descending order.*/ 
SELECT col.primary_collision_factor, vic.victim_degree_of_injury, COUNT(*) AS "total collisions"
FROM collisions col
INNER JOIN victims vic
ON col.case_id = vic.case_id
GROUP BY col.primary_collision_factor, vic.victim_degree_of_injury
ORDER BY "total collisions" DESC;

/* 3. To analyze the distribution of collision severities for different types of roads (e.g., highway, city streets) I used the COUNT function the get the total collisions and group them by their location type and order by the collision severity.*/
SELECT DISTINCT location_type, collision_severity, COUNT(*) AS total_collisions
FROM collisions
WHERE location_type IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location_type
ORDER BY collision_severity;

/* 4. Using a CTE I'm able to analyze what the top 5 most common primary collision factors for collisions that involved a fatality. Creating first the top_five table to get the result set, I then count how many total collisions are related to the top five factors by joining the top_five results to the collisions table.*/
